`cypher-front` is a platform where the user is able to cypher/decypher a message using one of the five cryptography algorithms available (AES, DES, 3DES, Blowfish and IDEA).

⚠️ _**this should not be used to cypher/decypher any real message, as the key is hardcoded in the application (for now)**_

This was made as part of a course in university, and will be improved in the future.

The cypher/decypher action is made via a REST API call. You can check the API here: [cypher-api](https://github.com/armr-dev/cypher-api)

`cypher-front` is hosted in Netlify, and you can access it [here](https://cypher-uea.netlify.app/).

#### TODO:
 - [ ] Add key param for algorithms;
 - [ ] Better responsiveness for mobile;
